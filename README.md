#Gamekit Docs

This documentation explains the components of the gamekit engine and contains articles about how gamekit works
and how the components can be used.

Feel free to fork the docs and contribute to them!
    
DocEngine is capable of handling multiple languages, so if you like, you can help translating the documentation
into your native language.

I will update the docs always in english first and will try to keep up with the german language afterwards.
Since I'm developing gamekit itself at the same time this fails epically :)

So if you want to help me out, please contribute!
